# Testing and change guide

## Validation posture

The repository now contains small host-side tests for Feather utility/state helpers and the C++ interactive hitbox layer. They validate parsing and pure logic but cannot emulate framebuffer, touchscreen, boot, network, or physical motion. The effective validation model remains **focused host tests plus controlled on-device testing**.

## Feather on-printer regression runner

Feather provides a hidden, opt-in G-code harness whose implementation remains a
cold lazy feature until a run actually starts. It is Feather-only; Headless has
no display plugin and does not register the command.

After deploying a changed Feather Python module, use a hard Klipper process
restart before testing. A normal Klipper `RESTART` rebuilds printer state in the
existing interpreter and can retain an already imported module in `sys.modules`.
On the printer, the explicit process restart is:

```sh
/opt/config/mod/.shell/restart_klipper.sh --hard
```

Run the complete unattended trace on an observed, idle printer with an empty
bed:

```gcode
_FEATHER_UI_TEST ACTION=RUN SUITE=FULL CONFIRM=1
```

`FULL` runs safe page traversal, render-worker restart/recovery, Home All plus reversible 1 mm XYZ moves,
material preheat/cooldown, `BED_LEVEL_SCREWS_TUNE CLEAN=0`, an unsaved
`AUTO_FULL_BED_LEVEL`, and a simulated center-zone Z-offset paper test. The Z
test uses the actual `PROBE`, ten 0.100 mm `FARTHER` actions to create 1 mm of
additional clearance, ten matching `CLOSER` actions, temporary Accept, and
mandatory Discard. It never saves the candidate. PID, input-shaper, and
extruder calibration are intentionally outside the physical suite.

Each hardware/UI phase is also independently runnable with `SUITE=UI`,
`RENDER`, `MOTION`, `HEAT`, `SCREWS`, `MESH`, or `Z`; pass an active material name through
`MATERIAL=PETG` when needed. Use these control commands while diagnosing a run:

```gcode
_FEATHER_UI_TEST ACTION=STATUS
_FEATHER_UI_TEST ACTION=ABORT
```

Every normal runner phase is also enclosed by an operation-context fixture.
The fixture records every `_changed` transition from the live
`operation_context` instance, removes only dynamic IDs/revisions, and compares
the complete ordered semantic trace. `SCREWS`, `MESH`, and `Z` validate their
expected contexts; the remaining phases validate that they create no context
and that no stack leaks into the next phase. Temperature waits have finite
`HEATING`, `COOLING`, and already-in-range variants, each of which is still an
exact full-trace comparison. A mismatch stops later physical steps but does not
skip cleanup.

Two deliberately separate, attended physical groups exercise workflows that
are too intrusive for `FULL`:

```gcode
_FEATHER_UI_TEST ACTION=RUN SUITE=CONTEXT_PRINT CONFIRM=2
_FEATHER_UI_TEST ACTION=RUN SUITE=CONTEXT_MATERIAL MATERIAL=PLA CONFIRM=2
```

`CONTEXT_PRINT` creates two uniquely named temporary virtual-SD files and runs
them in a fixed order dictated by physical state. The first forces KAMP with
nested nozzle cleaning and deposits no part. The second uses a loaded `auto`
mesh, runs mesh validation, and prints a fixed OrcaSlicer fixture: a 16 x 16 x
3 mm open box with three bottom layers, two walls, no sparse infill, and no
top. It exercises the UI pause/resume controls, then reaches a G-code `PAUSE`
after depositing layer 7 of 15, creates a normal resurrection checkpoint,
cancels the print, dismisses the cancellation dialog, and exercises Restore
without restarting Klipper. Recovery resumes at layer 8 and completes the
remaining model. OrcaSlicer's estimate for the extrusion portion is about two
and a half minutes. The model print is deliberately last: it leaves a part in
the bed centre, so every scenario that probes or wipes the bed must precede it.
Together the two files cover the `print`, `kamp`, `mesh_validation`,
`nozzle_clean`, and `recovery` contexts plus the print pause, resume, cancel,
and terminal-dialog controls.

`CONTEXT_MATERIAL` drives the normal action-prompt protocol: it selects the
requested material, performs Load, Purge, Unload, and Done, then selects the
same active cold-pull profile and completes a cold pull. The cold-pull macro
keeps one generic action-prompt visible while its existing operation-context
states run; its cancel button requests `_CONTEXT_CANCEL`, so the common
context cancellation path is used by Feather and Fluidd alike. It covers
`filament` and `cold_pull`. The final absence of filament after the cold pull
is expected physical state and is not reversed automatically.

Both extended groups require an observed standby printer, zero heater targets,
inactive virtual SD, no pause state left by an earlier print, empty operation
stack, the required probe/mesh/material profiles, no pre-existing recovery
checkpoint, a prepared empty bed, and prepared filament. `CONFIRM=2` is an explicit acknowledgement of those physical
preconditions; it is intentionally different from the normal suites'
`CONFIRM=1`. Do not run either extended group unattended. No manual G-code is
needed after starting it. `CONTEXT_PRINT` leaves its small printed fixture on
the bed; remove it before any further physical run. `CONTEXT_MATERIAL` in
particular must not follow it with the part still in place: its cold pull
re-homes, travels to the bed centre, and purges 100 mm of filament there, so
with a part in the way it extrudes onto the part at whatever height homing
left.

The physical model is one neutral G-code template beside a test-only material
profile file. The runner resolves the explicit `MATERIAL`, or the printer's
last selected material when the argument is absent, before it creates the run.
The current fixture profiles cover PLA and PETG and supply the OrcaSlicer
temperatures, flow ratio, pressure advance, firmware-retraction values, and fan
limit. An inactive material or a material without an exact complete fixture
profile fails immediately, before artifacts, heating, or motion begin; unlike
the other suites, `CONTEXT_PRINT` never substitutes another active material,
because the fixed model would then be printed with the wrong temperatures,
flow, and tuning. The fixture G-code overwrites pressure advance, firmware
retraction, and flow; the runner captures all three before it creates the files
and replays them during cleanup, so an interrupted run leaves no tuning behind.
A run refuses to start when any of those values cannot be restored.

`SUITE=RENDER` is non-physical: on an observed idle printer it requests a
worker-owned Typer restart, waits for the touch FIFO handoff and surface redraw,
then captures the recovered screen. It does not home, move, or heat the printer.
Every capture records renderer queue/restart diagnostics and waits until all
batches submitted before that capture have rendered or been accounted for; an
unexpected dropped batch fails the step instead of silently photographing an
older stable framebuffer.

`SUITE=UI` is also non-physical. In addition to the normal page traversal it
renders a temporary worst-case home dashboard (maximum temperatures, long
network/job/material strings, full progress and long durations) and captures it
before restoring the live state. The filament trace renders a synthetic
`130.4 / 250C` heating and `260.4 / 250C` cooling states without changing the
heater target or fan, captures the declarative action layout, follows the real Back hitbox to material selection,
and fails if that navigation changes the live nozzle target. Synthetic taps are resolved from the
renderer’s button, toggle, and declarative action-hitbox registries, so clickable
text/panels are covered without importing development-only page modules into
Feather’s normal startup path.

`SUITE=COMPONENT` is a second non-physical, cold test path used only by the
extended parity regression. It discovers module-level declarative pages after
the explicitly requested test has started, renders their default typed state
plus bounded additional scenarios through the real Feather renderer/Typer
path, and captures them without dispatching product actions or G-code. An
additional scenario accepts only a discovered page ID and bounded JSON values
for that page's declared typed-state keys; unknown pages, invalid
types/choices, actions, and extra fields are rejected. Runtime read-only values
are injected only into the isolated state snapshot and never written back to
product controllers. Both `UI` and
`COMPONENT` manifests
record the renderer's passive `semantic_page_id`; imperative legacy screens
record no semantic ID.

The harness validates live page generations and hitboxes before synthetic taps,
blocks physical non-emergency input plus every persistent Save action during a
run, and stops later hardware phases on the first unsafe failure. Before a new
run it consumes `/data/feather-ui-tests/active.json`; same-Klipper-session
recovery turns off heaters, restores the recorded runtime Z-offset and named
mesh state, and disables motors. A changed session treats volatile state as
already cleared by Klipper restart and marks the previous trace interrupted.

Artifacts live under `/data/feather-ui-tests/<timestamp>-<suite>/`: top-down
32-bit BMP files, `manifest.json`, `environment.json`, `run.log`, a sliced
`printer.log`, `temperatures.csv`, `positions.csv`, and `summary.json` with
calibration stages/results. Before a step capture, the test harness waits for a
Typer `presented` receipt. Framebuffer reads use the active page reported by
`/sys/class/graphics/fb0/pan`, honor the reported stride, and retry if a page
flip occurs during the copy. Stability hashing, BMP encoding, log copying,
CSV/JSON updates, and retention execute in the artifact worker thread. The
reactor only schedules steps and receives completion callbacks.
calibration stages/results. Context-enabled runs also write
`operation_context.json` with each selected fixture variant, exact expected and
actual traces, and scenario result; `summary.json` contains the compact context
result.
Retention keeps at most ten completed runs and 512 MiB, never deletes the active
run, and preserves the newest failure for inspection.

The extended groups temporarily change only runner-owned in-memory branch
fixtures and restore them during cleanup. They do not save configuration. The
runner restores heater targets, part fan, selected material, mesh/runtime Z,
idle timeout, and the patched material persistence hook; it removes only its
own temporary G-code files and checkpoint. Before and after any live group,
independently verify standby, zero heater targets, and inactive virtual SD, and
retain the artifact directory plus deployed UI fingerprint.

### Host-orchestrated unattended runs

`tests.printer_regression` is the separate developer-machine entry point for
recording and collecting the real printer suites. It does not replace the
on-printer runner: Feather still owns each scenario, its safety preflight, state
snapshot/restore, semantic screenshots, and suite outcome. The host owns only
suite ordering, camera capture, verified artifact transfer, video assembly, and
the local report.

Run the existing core `FULL` suite from the repository root with:

```bash
python3 -m tests.printer_regression \
  --printer <printer-host> \
  --suite core \
  --confirm-unattended-physical-test
```

The host-facing aggregate names deliberately differ from the printer's suite
names:

- `core` starts printer `FULL`;
- `print` starts printer `CONTEXT_PRINT`;
- `material` starts printer `CONTEXT_MATERIAL`;
- `all` runs `core`, then `print`.

That `all` order is a physical constraint, not a preference. `print` must follow
`core` because it leaves a real part in the bed centre and `core` probes the
bed. `material` is deliberately not part of `all`: the suites run back to back
with no operator stop, and `material` re-homes and then purges 100 mm of
filament above the bed centre - onto the part `print` just left there. Run
`material` as its own invocation once the bed has been cleared.

The existing individual `ui`, `component`, `render`, `motion`, `heat`,
`screws`, `mesh`, and `z` suites are also available. `full` is intentionally
not a host-facing alias. Use `--material PLA` only when an explicit profile is
needed; otherwise material selection remains owned by Feather.

The default recording rate is 10 FPS and the accepted range is 1-30 FPS. The
host discovers enabled webcams through Moonraker and records the camera
directly with FFmpeg. Because MJPEG does not provide a reliable media clock,
FFmpeg timestamps incoming frames by their host arrival time before normalizing
the recording to start at zero. A fluctuating or lower-than-declared camera FPS
therefore changes frame cadence without stretching the camera away from the
screen and telemetry timelines. Relative webcam URLs resolve to the printer's
HTTP port 80. `--no-camera` explicitly disables camera capture. An absent or
failed camera leaves the printer outcomes intact and produces screen-only media
when semantic screenshots are available.

The host also requests one coherent Feather framebuffer snapshot every 5
seconds by default. These periodic timeline records complement rather than
replace the settled semantic captures attached to meaningful test states, so
both small screen updates and unchanged holds remain visible in the assembled
video. A periodic snapshot reads the active framebuffer once and stores only
minimal timeline metadata; it does not wait for the UI to become visually
quiet. If the previous periodic snapshot is still pending, the next tick is
skipped instead of building an artifact backlog inside the Klipper process.
A periodic tick is also skipped while the toolhead has queued move time or an
unfinished lookahead, and while the operation context reports a state that
drives the toolhead against the bed: `HOMING`, `PROBING`, `LEVELING`,
`CHECKING MESH`, or `TARING`. Reading 1.5 MiB from the framebuffer during those
states competes with Klipper for the host and can end the run with an MCU
"Timer too close" shutdown. Every accepted semantic, stage, or periodic capture
first writes a `CAPTURE_QUEUED <label> eventtime=<t>` line to `run.log`, so a
post-mortem can distinguish a queued request from one the guard declined. The
reactor counters described below record whether the worker actually started it.
The worker writes each BMP as a small header plus the framebuffer payload and
publishes `manifest.json` once during finalization. It deliberately does not
fsync and rewrite the growing manifest after every periodic frame, because
that storage latency can delay the Klipper reactor during probing.
All reactor callbacks submit artifact work through an unbounded
`SimpleQueue`; only the single artifact thread opens the framebuffer or output
files. Each completed capture is appended immediately, without `fsync`, to
`artifact_timing.csv`. Its queued, worker-started, and worker-finished wall and
monotonic timestamps, queue delay, duration, kind, phase, and page survive a
later Klipper failure and distinguish scheduling delay from framebuffer and
file work. The kind separates the three request paths: `semantic` for a test
step's own capture, `stage` for one the printer's operation context triggered,
and `periodic` for the timeline interval. Stage capture follows every real
operation-context state change regardless of the current test phase. A long
action therefore updates the screen timeline while it remains active, and a
new workflow does not need to be added to a capture whitelist.
Settled semantic and stage captures wait for a quiet framebuffer by comparing
the interpreter's own `hash()` of each sampled frame, not a digest: SHA-256 is
computed exactly once, on the frame the loop finally accepts. The printer's
Python is built without `zlib`, so `crc32` is unavailable, and hashing 1.5 MiB
per 50 ms sample on the Cortex-A7 is host time taken from Klipper.
Use `--screen-capture-interval <seconds>` to select an interval from 5 to 300
seconds, or `--screen-capture-interval 0` to keep semantic captures only.
Capture remains inside the lazy test runner and its existing background
artifact worker; normal Feather runtime and the printer never encode video.

While a suite is active, the host records `telemetry.jsonl` at 1 Hz by
default. Each timestamped sample contains the live XYZ position and velocity,
homed axes, nozzle and bed temperatures/targets/power, print state and
progress, Feather page/generation, current suite/phase/step, and semantic
operation context. Each sample also records the motion buffer margin
(`toolhead.print_time` minus `estimated_print_time`), Klipper's `stalls`
counter, and the MCU's own `last_stats` load (`mcu_awake`, `mcu_task_avg`,
`bytes_retransmit`, `srtt`). Those are the host-side numbers that describe how
close a run came to a "Timer too close" shutdown, and they survive it because
the recorder flushes every line. A printer that publishes no `[mcu]` status
records a `null` block rather than failing the sample.
`--telemetry-rate <hz>` accepts 1-10 Hz, while
`--telemetry-rate 0` disables collection. Physical suites reject rates above
1 Hz because every query executes object status callbacks in the Klipper
reactor; higher rates remain available for non-physical UI, component, and
render suites. Sampling uses one bounded Moonraker object query per tick, and
that same status snapshot carries the active `run_id`. The active wait does
not poll over SSH: startup, ownership, completion, and abort observation use
Feather's Moonraker status. SSH is used only for bounded lifecycle actions such
as preflight, starting/stopping the independent resource sampler, and artifact
transfer. The configured value is the requested upper rate; the report also
records the effective rate because Klipper/Moonraker status publication may be
slower. An intermittent or unavailable telemetry stream is reported as a
warning and never rewrites the printer suite outcome.
During an active suite, successful RT status samples are also the host's
printer-process heartbeat. If no new sample arrives for 30 seconds, the host
stops waiting on a possibly stale run and records an
infrastructure failure instead of waiting for the suite's physical timeout.

One bounded printer-side shell process independently samples `/proc` once per
second into `resources.tsv`. It records system CPU ticks, load, available
memory, free swap, and per-process CPU ticks/RSS/state for Klipper, Moonraker,
Dropbear, and Typer. Per-process rows also expose thread count, voluntary and
involuntary context switches, minor and major faults, scheduler runtime/wait
and timeslices, I/O byte and syscall counters, and the current kernel wait
channel. This gives Typer telemetry without importing, tracing, or modifying
Typer itself. The sampler neither imports nor calls Klipper and therefore keeps
recording if the Klipper process or reactor fails. The host owns one persistent
foreground SSH transport for the sampler instead of repeatedly opening
Dropbear sessions, stops that exact local process after the physical suite,
copies the exact remote file, and removes it only after the local file is
verified to carry both the expected header and at least one sample row — a
header-only file means the printer-side pass never produced anything and is
reported as a failure rather than as an idle host.
Preflight, launch ownership, active waiting, and post-suite safety
observation use Moonraker and do not open additional SSH sessions.

Because this sampler observes host overload, its own cost is part of the
measurement. Each iteration therefore spawns one awk pass, one `tr` per Python
process it inspects, and `sleep`: the wall clock is anchored once with
`date` and advanced from the `/proc/uptime` delta, and every value in the row —
system memory and CPU ticks plus each process's `stat`, `status`, `schedstat`,
`io` and `wchan` — is produced by that awk pass in
`.shell/printer_resource_sample.awk`. That awk pass takes its tree from `root`,
so `tests/test_printer_resource_monitor.py` runs it against a `/proc` fixture;
the shell loop itself only gets a syntax check and a guard that no new command
substitution appears inside it. Classification stays in the shell because
busybox awk truncates strings at the NUL separators `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` uses,
which would make every Python process look identical to it.

`--no-resource-monitor` leaves the sampler out entirely and records the report's
resource status as `disabled`. Because the sampler is the only observer that
runs for the whole run — and even in its reduced form it reads the Klipper
process's `status` and `wchan` every second — excluding it is how a host
overload investigation isolates its cost from the capture and telemetry paths.

While the hidden test runner is active, a temporary 5 Hz reactor timer measures
its own scheduling lag. It aggregates one row per second into `reactor.csv`
through the existing artifact worker: average/max lag, longest callback
interval, exact eventtimes for both maxima, current phase/step, pending capture
state, sample count, and missed 200 ms deadlines. Each row also carries the
worker's cumulative `captures_queued`, `captures_started`, and
`captures_finished` counts. `queued > started` means a request was still
waiting in the artifact queue; `started > finished` means framebuffer work had
actually begun while the reactor was late. This is evidence
`artifact_timing.csv` cannot give for an interrupted capture, because its row
is written only after the capture returns. The timer is owned by the single
`UITestRun`, returns an explicit next wake time, and is unregistered on
completion, setup failure, or deactivation. It is not active during normal
Feather operation.

The inspection video uses a fixed 800x1080 vertical canvas: the native
800x480 Feather screen is above the printer camera, the complete camera image
is fitted without cropping into an 800x450 region, and an 800x150 RT panel is
below it. The panel is rendered from the timestamped JSONL timeline through a
raw in-memory bitmap stream; the host does not retain one uncompressed image
per telemetry sample. Its five compact rows show test/step, UI and printer
state, integer motion/heater values, operation context, and time-aligned
Klipper/Typer/Dropbear CPU plus RSS, available memory, and load from
`resources.tsv`. Screen transitions use printer-relative capture times
anchored only after the lazy runner is observed active; setup latency therefore
cannot advance the screen track ahead of the continuously recorded camera. Each
manifest timestamp describes when the artifact worker accepted the framebuffer,
not when the reactor queued the request. The screen area remains neutral until
the first observed frame instead of showing that future frame from time zero. A
missing screen or camera gets an explicit placeholder so the layout and timeline
remain stable.

Before any mutable printer command, the entry point verifies local FFmpeg,
SSH, SCP, artifact-root write access, disk capacity, Moonraker/Klipper
readiness, the Feather screen object, SSH access, idle print state, zero heater
targets, inactive virtual SD, and absence of another active UI-test run. The
confirmation option acknowledges an observed idle printer, a prepared empty
bed, and unattended motion/heating; it is translated into Feather's existing
`CONFIRM=1` or `CONFIRM=2` contract rather than bypassing it.

Each run gets a unique ignored directory under
`tests/artifacts/printer-runs/` unless `--output` selects another new directory.
It contains `report.html`, `report.json`, `recording.mp4` when media succeeds,
`telemetry.jsonl`, `resources.tsv`, and verified printer artifacts below
`suites/`. Each printer artifact can also contain `reactor.csv`. Large `work/`
intermediates are
removed only after successful media finalization and retained on failure.

For every launched suite the host observes the exact `run_id` and directory
from Feather's Moonraker status, copies that exact directory, verifies
`summary.json` ownership
and the screenshot/manifest contract, and only then removes the same remote
directory. It never cleans the printer artifact root globally. A copy or
verification failure preserves the remote source. If Klipper disappears before
finalization, the host attempts a non-destructive partial copy so `run.log`,
`reactor.csv`, screenshots, and other already-flushed evidence remain attached
to the infrastructure failure.

An ordinary printer test failure is reported and later selected suites still
run after host safety is re-observed. Lost connectivity, changed run ownership,
runner timeout/stall, cleanup failure, active print, non-zero heater target, or
active virtual SD stops later physical suites and records them as skipped. A
timeout uses Feather's existing explicit abort command; no service restart or
generic recovery ladder is attempted.

Normal host tests substitute Moonraker, SSH/SCP, clocks, camera processes, and
FFmpeg. They never require or contact a live printer:

```bash
python3 -m unittest tests.test_printer_regression
```

## Development-only semantic screenshot checks

Semantic screenshot review is a separate Mac host-side tool under
`tests/visual_checks/`. It is not imported, registered, configured, or executed
by Feather, Klipper, printer startup, or the on-printer UI test runner.
`sync.sh` excludes the complete `tests/` directory, so the checker is not
included in printer synchronization archives. It uses only Python's standard
library and adds no project, build, or printer dependency.

The tool is disabled unless the developer explicitly passes `--enable`. It
accepts either an already downloaded UI-test artifact directory (using its
`manifest.json`) or explicit BMP/PNG/JPEG/WebP files. It then uses the common
OpenAI-compatible `/models` and `/chat/completions` contract; there is no
provider-specific discovery, model download, or service management.
Feather's uncompressed 24/32-bit BMP frames are converted in memory to PNG
with the Python standard library before submission because some compatible
servers reject BMP vision input. The saved source artifact, its hash, and its
byte count remain unchanged. Responses use the OpenAI-compatible
`json_schema` format and are independently validated again by the checker.

Connection settings are host-local:

- `FF5M_VISUAL_BASE_URL` supplies the OpenAI-compatible base URL;
- `--model` or `FF5M_VISUAL_MODEL` supplies exactly one loaded model name;
- `FF5M_VISUAL_API_KEY` is optional and is never logged or serialized;
- `--timeout` / `FF5M_VISUAL_TIMEOUT` bound each HTTP request;
- `--mode advisory|strict` / `FF5M_VISUAL_MODE` select enforcement in the
  image-only command; the regression command uses `--check-mode`.

A safe invocation shape, intentionally omitting endpoint and credentials, is:

```bash
python3 -m tests.visual_checks.run \
  /path/to/saved-ui-test-artifacts \
  --enable \
  --model loaded-vision-model \
  --mode advisory
```

The generated `visual-checks.json` keeps, for every screenshot and its selected model, the
verdict, non-pass reasons, JSON-validation status, elapsed request time, and
normalized errors. It also distinguishes a disabled checker, unavailable
endpoint, absent configured model, rejected vision input, malformed response,
and other request failures. The endpoint address, API key, and raw error bodies
are not stored.

`advisory` is the default: warnings, model failures, and unavailable services
are recorded but return a successful process status. `strict` is honored only
when explicitly selected and returns a failure for any non-pass verdict or
integration error. Even in strict mode, semantic review supplements the
existing deterministic contracts and UI tests; it is never the sole source of
truth.

Host-side tests use an in-memory fake OpenAI-compatible endpoint. They open no
socket, invoke no model, and cover image payloads, fixed-schema validation,
error mapping, disabled/advisory/strict behavior, and two-image parity
payloads.

### Hybrid regression orchestration

`tests.visual_checks.regression` is the higher-level development command. It
validates the FF5M project with Feather UI Designer, automatically renders
every discovered module-level `DeclarativePage`, and creates a default case
for every discovered stable `PageKey`. The checked-in `scenarios.json` adds
only meaningful non-default typed states; it is not a page registry.
The current automatic/default plus explicit matrix contains 23 cases over
seven discovered pages, including unhomed/homed movement, joystick feedback,
fine/coarse steps, paper-test positioning/probing/ready states, Safe Z
probing/result, measured summary results, warnings, and dialogs. Runtime
read-only values are installed into an isolated Designer-host checkpoint for
rendering; the product state declarations and controllers are not changed.

The modes are:

- `designer`: local Designer frames only. While legacy pages remain, a clean
  result is reported as `partial`, not as a complete release gate.
- `hybrid`: Designer frames plus every frame from the existing printer
`SUITE=UI` whose `semantic_page_id` was not rendered by Designer. A printer
  frame with no semantic ID, or an unknown ID, stays in the corpus.
- `parity`: the hybrid corpus plus paired Designer/real-renderer checks for
  the same default and additional typed-state cases captured by the cold
  `SUITE=COMPONENT` harness.

Before a Designer scenario is accepted, the scenario adapter applies mutable
values through the Designer host state API so simulator-owned roles (for
example homing, position, inertia, and movement step) cannot overwrite the
requested typed state. It then verifies every requested value against the
rendered scene metadata. A silently ignored or normalized-away state fails
before capture and before any model request.

In `hybrid` and `parity`, the runner reads the active theme from the downloaded
printer artifact and uses that exact theme for Designer capture. UI and
COMPONENT artifacts must report the same theme. `--theme` remains an explicit
override for targeted diagnostics; Designer-only mode falls back to `DEFAULT`
when no override is supplied.

The default invocation shape is:

```bash
python3 -m tests.visual_checks.regression \
  --mode hybrid \
  --designer-root /path/to/feather-ui-designer \
  --printer-host <printer-host> \
  --confirm-printer-idle \
  --model <loaded-vision-model> \
  --enable
```

#### First local run and result review

Start with the local-only Designer corpus. It does not contact the printer and
is the normal first check after UI changes:

```bash
python3 -m tests.visual_checks.regression \
  --mode designer \
  --designer-root /path/to/feather-ui-designer \
  --enable
```

The default local `.env` may provide the single selected model, base URL,
timeout, and optional API key. Do not print, commit, or copy that file. An
explicit `--model loaded-vision-model` overrides only the model selection for
that run. The command creates an ignored timestamped directory below
`tests/artifacts/ui-regression/` and prints the absolute paths to `report.html`
and `report.json`.

While it runs, the command prints its current pipeline stage and then one line
for every completed model review. The review line includes the completed and
total frame counts, case ID, last-frame time, total elapsed time, and an ETA
derived from the mean time of the completed frames. Before the first result,
the ETA is reported as `estimating`. Output is flushed immediately and remains
visible when the regression is launched by the LM Studio benchmark command.
For example:

```text
[stage 5/6] Reviewing 63 screenshots
[review 0/63] waiting for first result; ETA estimating
[review 17/63] move-ready; last 6.8s; elapsed 1m 55s; ETA 5m 11s
```

Open `report.html` for the normal human review. It is an offline report with no
external scripts, fonts, services, or network requests. Keep it together with
the surrounding timestamped artifact directory because its images use safe
relative paths.

The report is screenshot-first:

- **Screenshot overview** is a dense grid of Designer pages and retained
  real-printer screens;
- **Designer ↔ real printer** is a separate continuation grid whose tiles show
  both renderer outputs side by side;
- desktop tiles deliberately use a large inspection scale: standalone frames
  target about 480 CSS pixels and parity pairs about 720 CSS pixels, reducing
  the number of columns so small visual differences remain visible;
- warning/failure tiles use prominent yellow/red borders and markers;
- clicking any tile opens a large modal with the images, textual baseline,
  model summary, reasons, JSON-validation evidence, timings, and checklist;
- run stages and collection/model evidence stay collapsed until requested.

The first parity image is always the Designer frame and the second is always
the real Typer/framebuffer frame. Hybrid/parity theme synchronization removes
normal theme-color differences. Footer-only live status (temperatures, network
address, preview/standby label) may still differ; page titles, controls,
dialogs, selections, and typed-state values must remain equivalent.

The reviewer first performs a standalone quality audit of every supplied
image, including ordinary Designer-only and printer-only screenshots. It
checks clearance from headers, borders, controls, and neighboring text;
internal padding; spacing and vertical rhythm; alignment; proportions;
hierarchy; and balanced whitespace. Readable text with no literal overlap can
still fail when the layout is visibly cramped, uneven, awkwardly aligned, or
unbalanced. Those findings use `aesthetic_defect` evidence and always produce
`fail`. Structural, content, dialog, selection, typed-state, clipping, overlap,
missing-content, and explicitly constrained-value defects use
`product_semantic` evidence and also produce `fail`.

For a parity pair, the reviewer performs both standalone audits before it
compares visible geometry and presentation from header to footer. A visible
Designer/printer difference that does not reduce the quality of either frame
uses `design_mismatch` evidence and produces `warn`; if it also creates an
aesthetic or product defect, `fail` takes precedence. Live and mock values are
classified as `dynamic_runtime` and compared by their role, plausible format,
readability, and location rather than by their literal value. Exact or
approximate numeric equality is required only when the case expectation
explicitly constrains that value. Permitted anti-aliasing and rasterization
differences use `rendering_only`. Neither `dynamic_runtime` nor
`rendering_only` can produce a warning or failure.

The JSON validator enforces the evidence/severity relationship. A mismatched
combination receives the same single corrective retry used for malformed JSON.
Advisory mode records `warn` and `fail` results for review without failing the
runner process; strict mode preserves them as the explicit regression gate.

Use the compact toolbar to filter by outcome or source. `report.json` remains
the machine-readable source of truth, while `report.md` is a short
terminal-friendly summary.

The runner also writes all three reports when discovery, printer collection,
fingerprint validation, image handling, or model setup fails before ordinary
review. In that case `report.html` starts with an infrastructure-failure
banner, and any images already collected inside the run directory remain
visible with `not_run` status. This makes every failed invocation reviewable
without bypassing a safety check or losing the evidence gathered before it.

Read the result in this order:

1. Open `report.html` and check the status banner and source-coverage cards.
2. `status` is `pass`, `review`, or `fail` for a complete hybrid/parity
   corpus. A Designer-only run intentionally reports `partial` after a clean
   review because legacy printer screens are absent.
3. `coverage` shows captured printer frames, retained legacy printer frames,
   replaced duplicates, and parity pairs. A real parity run must have a
   non-zero `parity_pairs` count.
4. Each `screenshots[]` record has `source`, `case_id`, source-artifact hash,
   textual-expectation references, and `case_result` with verdict, reasons,
   JSON-validation status, elapsed time, and normalized error.
5. `needs_baseline` means a newly discovered page or scenario has no approved
   textual expectation. The candidate file is written locally; add a reviewed
   text expectation before enabling model review again.

Use `--check-mode strict` only when an explicit CI/release gate is intended.
The usual local run is advisory; deterministic contract and UI tests remain the
primary checks in either mode.

If the report says `model_unavailable`, the local endpoint was reachable but
the selected model name did not exactly match its `/models` catalog. Load the
intended vision model in the local service, set its exact catalog ID through
`--model` or the ignored `.env`, and rerun. If it says `vision_unsupported`,
select a vision-capable model; do not weaken the image payload or JSON schema.
`invalid_response` means the model returned a response that failed independent
JSON validation. The checker makes one corrective retry with the same frame and
an explicit schema reminder; if it remains invalid, inspect the normalized
error, repeat the affected saved frame once, and rerun the complete corpus
before accepting a result. Repeated schema failures make that model unsuitable
for this regression gate.

After a successful local Designer run, a real hybrid or parity run still needs
separate explicit approval, an idle printer, and the command shown above with
`--confirm-printer-idle`. It must not be combined with synchronization or a
Klipper restart.

The live modes are deliberately blocked unless the printer host is explicit
and `--confirm-printer-idle` is present. Their preflight rejects printing,
paused, active virtual-SD, or non-zero heater-target states. They only invoke
the non-physical `UI`/`COMPONENT` suites and download their artifacts; they
never synchronize files or restart Klipper. Every printer artifact contains a
fingerprint of the deployed Feather UI/framework Python files; a missing or
different fingerprint stops the run before model review. A saved printer
artifact directory can be supplied with `--printer-artifacts` for a fully
offline rerun. The runner copies only its manifest, environment metadata, and
image files into the new timestamped run directory, so the HTML report remains
portable and never depends on the original artifact location.

Textual structured expectations and the fixed checklist are the only
checked-in baselines. Captured PNG/BMP files, model responses, reports, and
candidate baselines go under the ignored `tests/artifacts/` tree. If any
automatically discovered case lacks an expectation, no model request is made:
the run writes `expectations.candidate.json` and returns `needs_baseline`.

Only one model is accepted in a run. To choose between local models, rerun the
same saved corpus once per model, then compare reports without making requests:

```bash
python3 -m tests.visual_checks.compare_reports \
  /path/to/model-a/report.json \
  /path/to/model-b/report.json
```

The comparison reports JSON-validity, verdict counts, review rate, mean
latency, and normalized error counts. Endpoint addresses, API keys, and raw
secret-bearing errors are excluded from all regression artifacts.

To benchmark every already downloaded LM Studio vision model with a declared
parameter count no greater than 12B, use the separate host-only command. It
uses the native LM Studio API only for catalog, load, and unload lifecycle;
each visual inference still uses the provider-neutral OpenAI-compatible
pipeline:

```bash
python3 -m tests.visual_checks.lmstudio_benchmark \
  --designer-root /path/to/feather-ui-designer \
  --printer-artifacts /path/to/saved-ui-artifacts \
  --printer-artifacts /path/to/saved-component-artifacts
```

The command never contacts the printer and never downloads models or
dependencies. It excludes non-vision models, models above 12B, and models with
an unknown parameter count. Models run sequentially against the same saved
artifacts. Every loaded instance is unloaded and its absence verified before
the next model starts; an unload-verification failure stops the benchmark.

The ignored `benchmark.json` records structured-response validity, verdicts,
review rate, errors, model load time, complete corpus wall time, mean request
latency, model file size, and the LM Studio memory estimate when the local CLI
can provide one. Both LM Studio's reported load time and independently
measured load wall time are retained. Each model also has its own large-grid
HTML report. The API key and endpoint are not included in any report.

This is not a gap to hide: Forge-X changes early boot, services, printer motion, calibration, and low-memory behavior on specific hardware. A unit-like syntax check cannot prove the crucial outcomes.

## Minimum checks by change area

| Change area | Static review | On-device / integration validation |
|---|---|---|
| `.shell/S00init`, `.shell/S55boot`, `.shell/S99root`, `.bin/src/netd/`, mounts | Trace normal, soft-skip, hard-failure, first-run, daemon-ready timeout, and Stock-inert branches; verify every referenced deployed path | Cold boot default stock mode; non-Stock Ethernet/Wi-Fi and offline Feather; a controlled skip/fallback; first-run DB/bootstrap where feasible; retain logs |
| `.root/*` service scripts / `moonraker.conf` | Confirm chroot mount/path ownership, start-stop symmetry, PID handling, port/path consistency, config include ownership, and updater semantics; see [Chroot environment and web runtime](workflows/chroot-and-web-runtime.md) | Moonraker readiness on 7125, static UI reachability on 80, browser-to-Moonraker connection, service disable switches, display gates, and reboot persistence |
| `mod_params.json` / `zchanges.sh` | Confirm schema, defaults, migration/deprecation, macro declaration, and each keyed side effect | Toggle parameter, verify expected restart/reboot/service action and persistence; restore default |
| `config/` and `macros/` | Trace includes, renamed macros, shell command arguments, safe motion preconditions | Controlled homing, calibration, pause/resume/cancel, start/end print path using safe test conditions; recalibrate before production prints |
| `.py/klipper/patches` and `plugins` | Confirm target stock-module path/layout, `.bak` backup and stale-link cleanup behavior, plugin vs replacement classification, and optional tuning interactions; see [Built-in Klipper patching](workflows/klipper-patching.md) | Exercise the affected Klipper feature and inspect relevant logs; validate supported firmware version and uninstall/rollback path where the deployment changes |
| USB storage / boot media | Review sysfs ancestry, partition enumeration, mount ownership/access, destructive-device revalidation, and eMMC fallback | Test MBR/GPT-style kernel partitions, logical/multiple partitions, whole-disk filesystems, FAT/ext, existing ro/rw mounts, late device nodes, boot flags/firmware detection, and Fluidd prompt events; verify the actual USB device before destructive tests |
| Swap/ZRAM/memory tuning | Review defaults, bundled modules/scripts, and interactions with UI/services | Reboot, confirm selected swap mode and USB-to-eMMC fallback, observe service stability under representative load |
| Camera, screen, remote access | Review mode-specific config routing, process/pipe ownership, port boundaries, user-state ownership, and stock fallback; see [Screen modes and Feather](workflows/screens-and-feather.md) | Enable/disable cleanly between stock, Feather, headless, and affected Guppy modes; verify DHCP/network prerequisites, display status/error output, browser control, fallback, and recovery route |

Use the operator docs as test procedures where applicable—especially [`docs/PRINTING.md`](../docs/PRINTING.md), [`docs/CALIBRATION.md`](../docs/CALIBRATION.md), [`docs/SCREEN.md`](../docs/SCREEN.md), and [`docs/RECOVERY.md`](../docs/RECOVERY.md).

## Required safety gates

1. **Do not test new motion behavior on an uncalibrated printer.** Installation/uninstallation and config tuning can invalidate bed mesh/Z offset.
2. **Retain a recovery route before touching boot code.** Confirm the documented dual-boot/USB recovery route and preserve logs.
3. **Exercise stock mode before alternate modes.** Stock is the default and fallback path.
4. **Treat calibration/macro edits as hardware-risk changes.** Review the full macro chain; test with conservative conditions.
5. **Avoid destructive broad tests.** Do not wipe Moonraker state, overwrite user-owned `mod_data`, or alter private SSH material simply to validate a source change.

## Recent history: why these checks matter

Recent Git history provides concrete regression themes:

- **Firmware compatibility:** `adfed5c` added stock firmware 5.0.x/5.1.x support, expanding `S00init`, docs, and parameter behavior. Validate against the supported firmware range rather than assuming all stock releases work.
- **Memory constraints:** `b9322c4` added compressed ZRAM swap; `e637aff` capped glibc malloc arenas for Moonraker and GuppyScreen. Resource changes must be tested with the relevant services/screens running.
- **Boot/UI stability:** `0acb2ae` suppresses a stock slicer-upgrade nag only in stock-screen use; `c327a47` made Dropbear arguments configurable. Changes often have mode-specific effects.
- **Print safety:** `c243f88` resets mesh before nozzle cleaning to avoid a bad measured Z/potential scratching when mesh validation and cleaning coexist. Earlier commits refined cooldown conditions and mesh-profile defaults. Macro changes need physical workflow validation.
- **Klipper correctness:** `de8e6ab` fixes a shaper-calibration hang by draining a child result pipe. Patch changes require exercising the exact affected action, not merely booting.
- **Scheduling:** `5426a14` adds optional `klipper_rt` (`SCHED_RR`) behavior through parameter and restart paths. Validate enable/disable and service recovery.

An advanced pressure-advance patch was added and then reverted in nearby history. This reinforces the rule: do not retain a patch merely because it applies; prove it is safe and compatible in this target stack.

## Documentation expectations for future changes

Update this wiki when a change alters one of the following:

- boot/fallback/recovery topology;
- persistent-state ownership or migration;
- supported firmware/hardware envelope;
- externally visible service endpoint, updater, or authentication posture;
- display-mode, slicer, calibration, or macro contract;
- required validation or recovery procedure.

Keep the detailed operator instructions in `docs/` current as well. If validation cannot be performed on hardware, state that limitation in the change/release notes rather than implying coverage.
